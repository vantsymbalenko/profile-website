## Atomic Approach to Component Design

This project uses an atomic approach to designing components, where components are broken down into small, reusable pieces.

## Shared Components Library

The `library` folder contains shared components that are not specific to this project and can be easily moved to a separate project. These components are meant to be used as a library of reusable components for other projects.
